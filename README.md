# reDOKTOR
Шизоредактор для шизоигры написанный шизом для шизов

## Things to avoid
- Avoid creating situations when keys couldn't spawn or something like that, game will crash
- Making 20x20 level, game has a stroke rendering huge chunks
- Don't go overboard with editing the textures for the triggers, game can't really render most of them here
- DON'T YOU EVER DARE TO FORCE 5-IN-RAW/5-in-a-row BONUS
- Don't make gray balls metallic unless you want a true psychodelic experience of no textures

## Roadmap

- [ ] Clean code up a bit
- [ ] Edit hints
- [ ] Figure out every field of an entity
- [ ] Figure out why entities cluster size is always 1 and if it's possible to make a real schizo level
- [ ] Figure out all fields of the level header besides the metallic features size and how much balls to spawn
